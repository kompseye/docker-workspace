# About
This directory contains helpful aliases which you can use for building the
Docker image, running the image -- the running image IS the container. There
are aliases to help cleanup containers and images as well.

# How to use?
* Source the bashrc file: `source myMachine/.bashrc`
* Confirm you have the aliases: `alias`
